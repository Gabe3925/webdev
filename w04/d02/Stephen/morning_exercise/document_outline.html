<h1>Under the Western Freeway</h1>

<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>


<b><i>Under the Western Freeway</i></b> is the debut studio album by American indie rock band <a href="#">Grandaddy</a>. It was released on 21 October 1997 on Will Records. It was later reissued in the U.S. by <a href="#">V2 Records</a>.<a href="#">[1]</a>

<h2>Reception</h2>

<p>The album was fairly well-received critically. Allmusic gave the album a four star rating, noting similarities to the bands Pavement and Weezer, and described it as "a fairly brilliant album, combining a warm, earnest, and rustic feel with sometimes goofy experimentation".[2] CMJ New Music Monthly described it as "an eccentric psych-pop collection".[6] Andy Gill, writing for The Independent called it "one of the most beguiling debuts of the year...a fortuitous collision of Brian Wilson, Neil Young and the Pixies which throws out a stream of understated pop gems".[4] Front-man Jason Lytle's vocal performance was also praised, Jason Josephes of "Pitchfork" said: "If the lonely vocals of "Lineage" and "Collective Dreamwish of Upperclass Elegance" don't strike you there, you have no soul".[5]</p>

<p>According to Steve Taylor, in his book The A to X of Alternative Music, "Laughing Stock" is the album's standout track.[7] The track features guitars fed back on themselves building as the track progresses.[7]</p>
