## Peter Lai Shops On...

####Prompt:
Peter Lai continues to shop. Your task is to make the appropriate updates to his receipts table:

1. Yesterday, he purchased 3 Batman shirts (at $20.00 a pop) from Target.

2. Peter returned 'The Last Tycoon' to the local bookstore, and the store kindly refunded his card, so the purchase price should be updated to $0.00.

3. Add a 'returned' column onto the receipts table. It should take a boolean value and default to `false`.

4. Updated the 'returned' value for 'The Last Tycoon' to true.

5. Looks like Peter mis-typed JC Penney while inputting his receipts (he forgot the second 'E'). Make sure the store's spelling is correct for all relevant entries in the receipts table.

6. Peter is embarrassed about his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles bedspread and wants it deleted from the database. Indulge him.
