Today we pay a visit to the popular game, [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). 

####Directions

1. First, take 10 minutes to play the game. Get it out of your system.
1. Great, now wherever you are in the game, refresh the page. 
1. Now ask yourself:
   - What data needs to be stored?
   - Does it make sense to store this data server side or client side?
   - In what scenario(s) would the answer to the previous question be different?
