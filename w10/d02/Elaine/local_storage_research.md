## Intro to Local Storage

As we do dive into building more client-side applications, we're going to start thinking about how and where we store and manage our data. In doing so, we'll make use of browsers' local storage, introduced in HTML5. Take the next 15 minutes to research local storage, answering the questions below.

- What is local storage?
  - Answer:
  Client-side storage. Stores named key-value pairs within the browser.

- What problem does it solve?
  - Answer:
  Space contraints with cookies (4k). Local storage has 5 MB per website.

- What are the alternatives?
  - Answer:
  Cookies (small). Database (located elsewhere).

- Come up with a scenario in which local storage would be useful.
  - Scenario:
  Offline work such as Evernote or Google Docs. API calls. User preferences.

- Think of a scenario where server-side storage would be preferred.
  - Scenario:
  Huge volume of data (database would be preferable). Limitations of local storage is that data saved on your local machine cannot be accessed from another machine.
